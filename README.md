# DataStructures and Algorithms

Algrithms should be unambiguous (not more than one meaning/step)

Analysis:
A Priori Analysis : Theorectical Analysis - Without implementing it - Assuming all factors
A posterior Analysis : Emprical Analysis - Implement and anaysed

Complexity:
Time : counted by number of key operations
Space : counted by max memory space used by program (number of variables static/dynamic used)


Three types :
 Best case : Upper bound of algorithms running time -  Ω notation
 Worst case : Lower bound of algorithms running time - O notation
 Average case : average of Best and worst case - θ notation
